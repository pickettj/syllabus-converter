# Email Etiquette

From your perspective, email probably feels boring and antiquated. But most of your instructors are GenX and Millennials, which means they can (*almost*) remember when email was new and exciting. In any case, Pitt gave you each @pitt.edu email accounts for a reason: promptly responding to communication from your official account is a *course requirement*, not just a courtesy.

And it is important to give *good* email. At a bare minimum:

- Write a clear subject line.
  - For instance, it is helpful to include course number and topic (e.g., "HIST 0753: Question about Assignment 2")
- Open with a stodgy, formal greeting: "Dear [Professor Professorson](https://community-sitcom.fandom.com/wiki/Sean_Garrity)"
  - "Hello Professor Professorson," "Greetings," etc., is probably okay... but avoid "Hey dude."
  - *Pro-tip*: if your instructor (or boss) responds to your salutation with their first name, you can address them that way going forward. (Remember: your instructors are   ̶i̶̶n̶̶s̶̶e̶̶c̶̶u̶̶r̶̶e̶̶ ̶a̶̶n̶̶d̶̶ ̶v̶̶a̶̶i̶̶n̶̶ justifiably proud of the achievements that gave them that doctorate, so err on the side of caution until they indicate otherwise.)
- Remind your instructor who you are: e.g., "I'm [Abed Nadir](https://community-sitcom.fandom.com/wiki/Abed_Nadir) from your Tuesday/Thursday HIST 0753 'Conspiracy Theories & Interior Design' (class."
  - Your instructors are interacting with hundreds of students each day. Plus they are old and broken and their backs hurt. Do them this kindness.
- State your purpose clearly, getting to the point immediately.
  - It should be clear just from scanning through the email what the "ask" is, what the associated deadlines are, whether this is a time-sensitive email or one that can wait until the weekend.
- Wrap it up professionally: "Best regards," "Thank you," "Sincerely."

Other considerations:

- Always, *always* acknowledge an email sent to you by an instructor, especially if it addressed you directly. 

  - This can be a quick "understood!"; but if you do not respond, you've added a new item to your instructor's already very full to-do list.

- Responding within 24 hours is "delightfully prompt"; within 48 hours is "on time"; and 72 hours or more is "delinquent."

- Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

  - Don't email the way you text: these are different mediums. No emails that are all lower case, no emojis, and, for the love of god, no gifs.

  

## Sample Email
```
Subject: HIST 1287: "Nicolas Cage: Good or Bad?"" - Extra Credit Opportunity Question

Dear Professor Duncan,

My name is Annie Edison, and I'm in your Monday/Wednesday "Nicolas Cage: 
Good or Bad?" seminar. I'm preparing my final argumentative essay (currently 
at 47 pages, but I can trim it down), and I wanted to ask: does citing 
National Treasure 2 count as a primary or secondary source?

Also, I noticed the syllabus mentions a possible extra credit opportunity for 
attending a Nic Cage film festival. I've already purchased tickets to all 
seven screenings and prepared comparative viewing notes. Should I submit 
those separately, or incorporate them into my final thesis defense?

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to our class debate on Thursday!

Best regards,
Annie Edison  
Sophomore, Pre-Law  
```
