# Office Hours

What are 'office hours'? The best way to understand what office hours are really all about is to [watch this explanatory video](https://vimeo.com/270014784):

Office hours are *your* time! You do not need to email me in advance to let me know you are coming: just show up at my office door whenever you like during the time slot. You do not need to have a specific, or even course-related question: we can gossip about Pitt or discuss the latest Assassin's Creed game. 

Please try to make the designated time work for your scheudle. But, if you can't fit it in, send me an email (pickettj[at]gmail.com) and we will figure something out.
