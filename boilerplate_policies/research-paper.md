# Research Paper Structure

### Front Matter

The reader should immediately know who wrote the paper and what it is about. You should not have a separate title page: real articles do not have one.

- Heading:
  - Title (and optional subtitle)
    - A common strategy is to make the main title short, evocative, and pithy (or, best of all, featuring a pun!), followed by a longer, more informative sub-title. But there is no rule or field standard.
  - Full Name
  - Affiliation
    - in a published article, this information would include institutional affiliation and (possibly) title and email
    - for a university course paper, this should include:
      - the name of the course
      - semester
      - instructor name

### Introduction

This section (which may or may not be designated with a sub-heading) explains your major research questions and posits an argument-driven thesis.

- The first paragraph is the *hook*: draw your reader in with exciting questions or an illustrative anecdote. (Historians over-use the "cold open" approach, but when it works it works.)
- The hook is followed by some kind of general discussion of your major research questions.
- The thesis should be obvious to the reader within the first three paragraphs.
- The length of the introduction depends on the length of the paper, but for an article (usually around 20 pages, 10,000 words) one paragraph for the intro will feel short and three pages will feel long.

### Literature Review / Historiography

Most published papers do not have a formal historiography section (instead integrating the discussion of the literature throughout the paper or including it in the introduction), but it is a requirement for many course papers. 

By the time you sit down to write a research paper, the historiography of your narrow field will seem obvious and natural to you. But you have to *teach* your readers (even informed readers):

- What are the major questions of this subfield of scholarship?
  - How do those questions relate to the concerns of larger fields? For instance, if you are studying nationalism in the Russian Empire, how does that sub-field relate to more theoretical scholarship about nationalism as a phenomenon?
- What are the most interesting debates, and how do they relate to one another?

A common (and understandable) mistake is to simply describe the field, moving from one work to the next,  organized into separate paragraphs. Your job is to *make sense* of the field for your reader, which means there is more of an *argument* implicit in this section than may first meet the eye: you are making a case for how the reader *ought* to understand the field. After all, with hundreds, thousands of detailed publications advancing nuanced arguments, you cannot possibly simply summarize them in a few paragraphs. Inevitably, you are *curating* that information for the readers, so better to be self-conscious and deliberate about it.

### Body Paragraphs

A research paper can be divided into any number of sub-sections (which may or may not have sub-headings). Usually a section is 2-5 pages long. The important point is not how long the section is, but whether or not it relates naturally to a sub-argument that relates to the larger thesis of the paper. In other words, the reader ought to have a sense not only of the topic that unites the sub-section, but the argument it is advancing, and it should be clear how that smaller argument specific to the section relates to the broader argument of the research paper.

What is a paragraph? The purpose of a paragraph is not to structure the white space on a page, although breaking up a wall of text is a pleasant aesthetic side-effect. The paragraph is an *organizational* convention. In a reseach paper, the first sentence of the paragraph informs the reader of the general idea organizing the rest of the paragraph. Quite often this sentence is an argument of some kind. Then most, if not all, of the internal sentences are positing facts in support of the general idea or sub-argument (which means they need a citation: see below). Then the concluding sentence has two responsibilities: to sum up the content of the paragraph, and also to serve as a lead-in or bridge into the next one.

### Conclusion

Time to wrap it up! The conlcusion is less standardized as a genre than the preceding sections. At a minimum, you should rephrase and restate the major arguments from the chapter. A strong, underused strategy might be to do that in a paragraph or two and curtains close. You might also:

- Acknowledge and address weaknesses and possible criticisms of your argument. Are there important sources you did not or could not examine? What is the strongest counterargument to your conclusions?
  - This does not undermine your arguments: it strengthens them by reassuring the reader that you were already compensating for potential shortcomings and taking criticisms on board.
- Chart a path for future inquiry: how might you or other scholars continue this line of inquiry?


### Citations, Notes, and Bibliography

Every single factual assertion in the paper must be accompanied by a citation. Every single one. This means that many body paragraphs will have a citation associated with nearly every sentence.

Historians use [Chicago Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html). If you [use Zotero](https://courses.bactriana.org/policies/zotero), all you need to do is select Chicago for the stylesheet, and the app will take care of the rest. If you are citing by hand, you are responsible for correct formatting.

90% of historians strongly prefer footnotes over endnotes. If you are writing a paper for a class, use footnotes.

If you are using full notes (instead of short notes), which you should, then there is no need for a separate bibliography, strictly speaking: all of the citation information is in the foontote itself. Many journals therefore omit separate bibliographies because they take up space, and space costs money. For a course paper, however, always include a bibliography in addition to full footnotes. (Zotero can also produce a bibliography for you automatically.)
